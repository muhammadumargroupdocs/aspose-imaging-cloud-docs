**Aspose object detection service** simplifies the process of integrating image processing and analysis into your application. By using our API, developers can quickly enrich their solutions with image object detection features, and therefore, increase their business value.

Aspose object detection API offers an opportunity to detect object boundaries on an image, as well as the objects' labels and scores. To fulfill this task, API utilizes a popular library libtensorflow along with Single Shot Multibox Detector.

Images could be passed to the server in request body or uploaded to a storage previously. You can find the detailed information about API usage in our official [blog](https://blog.aspose.cloud/category/imaging/).
