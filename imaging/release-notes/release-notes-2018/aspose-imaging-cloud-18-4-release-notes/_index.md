#### **API changes**
Optional *storage* parameter, which represents the Aspose Cloud Storage name (if you have more than one storage and want to use non-default one) had been added to the most of POST requests (like it was for the most of GET requests). Please, look at the updated [API reference page](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/imaging) and corresponding SDK basic usage examples.
#### **Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDK changes**
Along with this release, we've added the all-new Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDK for Java, which you can get from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-imaging-cloud/aspose-imaging-cloud-java). Also, basic usage examples had been added for the existing SDKs (.NET and Java).
