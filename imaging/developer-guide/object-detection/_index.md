## **Overview**
[**Object detection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection#:~:text=Object%20detection%20is%20a%20computer,in%20digital%20images%20and%20videos.) is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images

With the help of this feature, users are able to detect object boundaries on an input image, as long as their labels and probabilities.

Currently, we support 3 image formats (bmp, jpeg, and jpeg2000) and Single Shot Detector (SSD) method to recognize objects; however, we are planning to integrate several more methods and image formats in the future.

As a result, we can get json object with detected object bounds, labels, and scores or a result image with object bounds and labels on it.
